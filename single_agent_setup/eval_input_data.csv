"Create a repository name of a star wars character after checking that the repository already doesnt exist, create an issue for adding a README for creating a calculator then commit code and readme for it close the issue after.","The current language of the user is: English. I need to first find a suitable star wars character name for the repository. Then I need to check if a repository with that name already exists. If it doesn't, I'll create the repository, create an issue for adding a README for creating a calculator, commit the code and README, and finally close the issue.  I'll start by searching for a list of Star Wars characters. Since I don't have direct access to the internet, I'll use a common name like ""r2d2"" as a starting point.",search_repositories,"{""query"": ""r2d2""}","
